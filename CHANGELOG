  * Reverted thumbnail sorting feature - it's fast but makes terrible quality
    thumbnails. It's just not worth it.

  * Added sorted thumbnail processing. This improves thumbnail generation
    speed by about 25% for 4.5 meg jpegs with 5 thumbnails.
  * Fixed broken resize for non-fixed-width thumbnails.
  * Added check for bad geometry strings.
  * Added dependencies and Rubyforge project to gemspec, updated docs.
