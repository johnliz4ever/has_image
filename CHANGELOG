  * Improved partitioned path handling to avoid collisions when the id is
    very high, which can happen if you use db:fixtures:load.

  * Fixed a bug where overwriting a previous image triggered callbacks more
    than once, causing errors.

  * Downcased generated file names to avoid potential issues on
    case-insensitive filesystems.
  * Added "absolute path" method to model instances.
  * Made image deletion nullify the "has_image_file" field.
  * Added "has_image?" method to model instances.
  * Fixed ENONENT error with record update when there are no images yet.
  * Reverted thumbnail sorting feature - it's fast but makes terrible quality
    thumbnails. It's just not worth it.

    speed by about 25% for 4.5 meg jpegs with 5 thumbnails.
