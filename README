= HasImage -- Image attachment plugin/gem for Ruby on Rails

HasImage was created as a smaller, simpler, lighter alternative to
attachment_fu[http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu] for applications
that need to handle uploaded images.

attachment_fu:

* creates a separate database record for each thumbnail, then never really
  uses them for anything.
* recreates all the thumbnails every time you save your model - even if you 
	only edited the database fields.
* provides no facility out-of-the box for making square thumbnails without
	distortion.
* is hard to make work with a Javascript-based thumbnail cropper (like on digg
  or mypictr.com)

By contrast, has_image:

* creates one record per image, no matter how many thumbnails you make.
* is specialized, opinionated and perhaps even a little bit dumb. Has_image
  has extremely humble aspirations - it only does images, only uses local
  storage and only uses MiniMagick...
* ...BUT is easy to hack if you want to change it to work with AWS or another
	image processing library
* provides cropping methods so you can create an image cropper if you want.

Why not just add this functionality to attachment_fu?

I wanted to create something leaner and more fun for people to hack on.
Also... laziness, impatience and most of all, hubris.

Examples
========

Point-and-drool use case. Probably not what you want but hey, it pretty much
works.

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
	has_image
end

Single image, no thumbnails, with some size limits:

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
	has_image :resize_to => "200x200",
		:max_size => 3.megabytes,
		:min_size => 4.kilobytes
end

Image with some thumbnails:

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
	has_image :resize_to => "640x480",
		:thumbnails => {
			:square => "200x200",
			:medium => "320x240"
		},
		:max_size => 3.megabytes,
		:min_size => 4.kilobytes
end

More documentation will be added once this thing has a version number that
doesn't begin with 0.0.0.0.0.0. For now, it's so changing so often you'd be
crazy to use this thing unless reading the source is enough for you.

Getting it
==========

Has image is designed to work with Rails 2.1 and is installed via Ruby Gems;
no need for a plugin. To use it in your app, install the gem:

gem install norman-has_image --source http://gems.github.com

and add 

require 'has_image'

to your environment.rb file.

Git repository: 

http://github.com/norman/has_image

Hacking
=======

Don't like the way it makes images? Want to pipe the images through some crazy
seam carving library written in OCaml, or watermark them with your corporate
logo? Happiness is just a monkey-patch away:

module HasImage
	class Processor
		def resize(size)
			# your new-and-improved thumbnailer code goes here.
		end
	end
end

Has_image follows a philosophy of "skinny model, fat plugin." This means that
it tries to pollute your ActiveRecord model with as little functionality as
possible, so that in a sense, the model is acts like a "controller" and the
plugin like a "model" as regards the image handling functionality. This makes
it easier to test, hack, and port to other frameworks, because the storage and
processing functionality is largely independent of your model.
